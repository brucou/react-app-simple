- In this model, machine can only receive events from component inside the machine
  - only those component are passed the trigger function
  - is it necessary to pass events from outside?
  - how to have two machines in different places communicate?
  - is not that a case of inter-component communication (sibling component communication)
  - cf. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36143767/react-js-communicating-between-sibling-components
  - callback seems to be the way
  - so machine could have a onOutput event
    - which should filter or not the NO_OUTPUT?? preferably not, as this is also information
